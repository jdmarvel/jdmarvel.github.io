                <p>My research examines how citizens form judgments about government performance. I'm particularly interested in the role of artificial intelligence in shaping democratic discourse and public opinion. I also do research on organizational behavior and personnel management in the public sector.</p>

                <p>Outside of work, I like to read fiction and coach my son's baseball and basketball teams. I also like to watch NFL (Patriots) and college football, NBA (Celtics) and college basketball (American U), and my daughter's club soccer team (Arlington Soccer Association).</p>

                <p>Prior to working at American, I worked for ten years in the Schar School of Policy and Government at <a href="https://www.gmu.edu/">George Mason University</a>. During the 2017-2018 academic year, I was a Fellow at the <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/">United States Office of Evaluation Sciences</a>, where I helped design experiments to evaluate federal policy and program effectiveness.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="paper-content">
                    <p class="pub-description">Merton discusses the relationship between goals and the way people go about achieving those goals.  For instance, to win a competition might be a goal; engaging in fair play against a well-matched opponent would be a way to go about achieving that goal. Another way to go about achieving that goal would be to cheat--to bribe the referees, or to seek out a weak opponent, etc. There are appropriate (i.e., good faith, institutionally prescribed) means of achieving a goal and inappropriate (i.e., bad faith, illegitimate) means of achieving a goal. Merton analyzes what happens when goals and the way people go about achieving those goals fall out of balance--when we become obsessed with achieving a goal by any means or when we do something without any clear end in mind. What happens when we only care about winning a competition, and take no satisfaction in the competition itself? (Or when we only care about publishing, and experience no pleasure in the research and writing of an article?)  What happens when we do the same thing over and over, and forget why we are doing it?</p>
                    <p class="paper-note">"An effective equilibrium between the two phases of the social structure is maintained as long as satisfactions accrue to individuals who conform to both constraints, viz., satisfactions from the achievement of the goals and satisfactions emerging directly from the institutionally canalized modes of striving to attain these ends. Success, in such equilibrated cases, is twofold. Success is reckoned in terms of the product and in terms of the process, in terms of the outcome and in terms of activities. Continuing satisfactions must derive from sheer participation in a competitive order as well as from eclipsing one's competitors if the order itself is to be sustained. The occasional sacrifices involved in institutionalized conduct must be compensated by socialized rewards." </p>
                    <p class="pub-description">I've found that Merton's argument reliably stimulates classroom discussions about the tension between organizational processes and organizational goals, the tension between bureaucratic formalization and performance. Merton emphasizes that an imbalance between means and ends threatens group cohesion and results in feelings of hopelessness and alienation:</p>
                    <p class="paper-note">"As we shall see, certain aspects of the social structure may generate countermores and antisocial behavior precisely because of differential emphases on goals and regulations. In the extreme case, the latter may be so vitiated by the goal-emphasis that the range of behavior is limited only by considerations of technical expediency. The sole significant question then becomes, which available means is most efficient in netting the socially approved value? The technically most feasible procedure, whether legitimate or not, is preferred to the institutionally prescribed conduct. As this process continues, the integration of the society becomes tenuous and anomie ensues." </p>

                </div>
                <div class="paper-content">
                    <p class="pub-description">Pollard surveys the change in customs and orientations toward work that attended the rise of the factory mode of organization. Efficient factory production required a level of discipline and regularity that individuals were not used to. Factory employees had to be habituated to this new way of working, this new kind of employment. They had to accept that they were now "little wheels"--cogs--in a mechanical system.</p>
                    <p class="paper-note">"The worker who left the background of his domestic workshop or peasant holding for the factory, entered a new culture as well as a new sense of direction. It was not only that 'the new economic order needed ... part-humans: soulless, depersonalised, disembodied, who could become members, or little wheels rather, of a complex mechanism'. It was also that men who were non-accumulative, non-acquisitive, accustomed to work for subsistence, not for maximization of income, had to be made obedient to the cash stimulus, and obedient in such a way as to react precisely to the stimuli provided."</p>
                    <p class="pub-description">Students are surprised to learn that child labor was common, and that children began working at very young ages: </p>
                    <p class="paper-note">"In the predominantly youthful population of the time, the proportion of young workers was high. In the Cumberland mines, for example, children started work at the ages of five to seven, and as late as 1842, 200-250 of the 1,300-1,400 workers in the Lonsdale mines were under eighteen. At Alloa collieries, 103 boys and girls of under seven were employed in 1780. In the light metal trades, the proportion was higher still. Josiah Wedgwood, in 1816, had 30 per cent of his employees under eighteen, 3.3 per cent under ten years of age. The greatest problems, however, were encountered in the textile mills."</p>

                <div class="paper-content">
                    <p class="paper-note">"Tess ... started on her way up the dark and crooked lane or street not made for hasty progress; a street laid out before inches of land had value, and when one-handed clocks sufficiently subdivided the day." —Thomas Hardy, Tess of the d'Urbervilles</p>
                    <p class="pub-description">Thompson describes how technological advances in time-keeping radically altered the rythms of people's lives and their experiences of temporality. As affordable pocket watches became widely available, more and more people accepted (or were forced to accept) a new societal dispensation in which time could be measured and harnessed in service of large-scale production. Leading up to and during the industrial revolution, we see an evolution away from irregularity and "natural" time to regularity and mechanized time. This development facilitates efficient control of labor by management and provides fertile soil for the growth of new organizational forms--forms that are the pre-cursors to the modern bureaucratic organization.</p>
                    <p class="paper-note">"It is a commonplace that the years between 1300 and 1650 saw within the intellectual culture of Western Europe important changes in the apprehension of time."</p>    
                    <p class="pub-description">Students find it fascinating that a simple pocket watch could have had such large and pervasive effects on society. (I also like to go on a bit of a self-indulgent tangent about how the author is <i>the</i> E.P. Thompson--the Thompson who wrote <i>The Making of the English Working Class</i>.) Watches and clocks with minute hands and second hands equipped owners of capital with a means of turning a day into a <i>work day</i>.  We see the long after-effects of this transformation all around us: It is taken for granted that employees must show up to work <i>on time</i>, that employees have 30 minutes for lunch, and so on. </p>
                    <p class="paper-note">"In all these ways--by the division of labor; the supervision of labour; fines; bells and clocks; money incentives; preachings and schoolings; the suppression of fairs and sports--new labour habits were formed, and a new time-discipline was imposed."</p>

Students find it easy to understand and it spurs discussion on a number of interesting and important management questions: Do piece-rate pay systems yield higher productivity than hourly wage systems? How and why might a team of four orange-pickers do better than the summed productivity of four independent individuals? How would you design an incentive system to minimize free-riding in teams? What are the advantages and disadvantages of different kinds of performance pay plans?</p>

                </div>
                <div class="paper-content">
                    <p class="paper-note">From the abstract: We mailed letters to non-existent business addresses in 159 countries (10 per country), and measured whether they come back to the return address in the United States and how long it takes. About 60% of the letters were returned, taking over six months, on average. The results provide new objective indicators of government efﬁciency across countries, based on a simple and universal service, and allow us to shed light on its determinants. The evidence suggests that both technology and management quality inﬂuence government efﬁciency, just as they do that of the private sector.</p>
                    <p class="pub-description">This is great for stimulating discussion about government performance--how to measure it, what can be done to improve it, and how the things government organizations do are often different than the things private organizations do. Before revealing the results, I like to ask students to guess which of the world's 100s of post offices performs best. Students almost never guess USPS, even though it is the decisive winner.</p>

                <div class="paper-content">
                    <p class="pub-description">This is a really cool paper that examines how cash incentives affect the performance of escape room teams. It's also an important empirical contribution because we don't know much about how cash incentives are related to the performance of tasks that require critical thinking and creativity--<i>nonroutine</i> tasks, as opposed to rote, mechanical tasks like orange-picking.  The authors also do something that is really, really clever: they experimentally induce a "demand for leadership" in some teams but not others. They do this by "nudging (or not nudging) teams to pick a leader" before they enter the escape room. They find that cash incentives <i>do</i> improve performance, and that teams induced to pick leaders perform better than teams that are not induced to pick leaders. The paper reliably drives discussion on team leadership, team performance on nonroutine tasks, and team-based performance pay.</p>

                    <h4>Large language models and conversational counter-arguments to anti-public sector bias</h4>
                    <p class="pub-description">Can a good argument change an individual’s mind? In two pre-registered experiments, we explore this question in the domain of public sector organizational performance. In each of these experiments, we observe human subjects as they engage in a conversation with a generative artificial intelligence (AI) programmed to persuade its interlocutors that United States federal agencies perform, on the whole, quite well. In a third pre-registered experiment, we explore the potential dark side of AI-based persuasion strategies by testing whether subjects find an AI that panders to their pre-existing beliefs about public sector performance more credible than an AI that challenges those beliefs. We develop a theory of effective argumentation to synthesize potential answers to an array of specific, practical questions of persuasion. To attempt to answer these questions, we program a large language model (LLM) to argue in one of seven distinct “styles,” including an aggressive style, a didactic style, and a sycophantic style. Our results suggest that these different argumentative styles vary in their effectiveness, and that there may be a dark side to LLM-based persuasion.</p>

                    <h4>People are saying: What conversations with large language models and other novel data sources can teach us about how Americans view their government</h4>
                    <p class="pub-description">What do Americans say and think about the federal government?  This is a deceptively simple question. It may at first seem obvious that we know a great deal concerning what Americans think about their government, given the regular appearance in prominent news outlets of poll results on such topics as trust in institutions, blame for government shutdowns, and approval or disapproval of specific policies. But survey answers are, necessarily, constrained.  They are choices selected from a limited menu of response options at a particular moment in time.  The premise of our study is that we would learn a great deal more if we were to listen to what people actually say, because what people say about the federal government can teach us a great deal about what they <i>think</i> about the federal government.</p>

                    <p class="pub-description">We act on this premise by systematically examining three novel sources of data.  First, we analyze over one thousand conversations between American citizens and generative large language models (LLMs) that we programmed to discuss the federal government and the performance of its constituent agencies.  Second, we look at what people say when they are asked to provide an open-ended justification for why they view a particular federal agency negatively.  Third, we asked citizens to imagine three ways in which the federal government could be improved; we assess their imagined improvements with the aim of understanding the sorts of things Americans think their government <i>should</i>---and, in their imaginations, at least---<i>could</i> be doing.</p>
