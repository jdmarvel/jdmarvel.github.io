            <div class="content">
                <p>I'm an Associate Professor of Public Administration at <a href="https://www.american.edu/">American University</a> in Washington, DC, where I teach quantitative methods and research design to MPA and Ph.D. students.</p>
                
                <p>My research examines how citizens form judgments about government performance, with a focus on experimental methods and statistical analysis. I'm particularly interested in the role of artificial intelligence in shaping democratic discourse and public opinion.</p>

                <p class="paper-note">"Child work immeasurably increased the complexities of the problem. It had, as such, been common enough before, but the earlier work pattern had been based on the direct control of children and youths, in small numbers, by their parents or guardians. The new mass employment removed the incentive of learning a craft, alienated the children by its monotony and did this just at the moment when it undermined the authority of the family, and of the father in particular. It thus had to rely often on the unhappy method of indirect employment by untrained people whose incentive for driving the children was their own piece-rate payment."</p>  
                             <p class="paper-note">"In the predominantly youthful population of the time, the proportion of young workers was high. In the Cumberland mines, for example, children started work at the ages of five to seven, and as late as 1842, 200-250 of the 1,300-1,400 workers in the Lonsdale mines were under eighteen. At Alloa collieries, 103 boys and girls of under seven were employed in 1780. In the light metal trades, the proportion was higher still. Josiah Wedgwood, in 1816, had 30 per cent of his employees under eighteen, 3.3 per cent under ten years of age. The greatest problems, however, were encountered in the textile mills."</p>
