            <div class="content">
                <p>I'm an Associate Professor of Public Administration in the <a href="https://www.american.edu/spa/">School of Public Affairs</a> at <a href="https://www.american.edu/">American University (Washington, DC)</a>, where I teach courses on quantitative methods, organization theory, public management, and research design to MPA, MPP, and PhD students.</p>

                <p>My research examines how citizens form judgments about government performance. I'm particularly interested in the role of artificial intelligence in shaping democratic discourse and public opinion. I also do research on organizational behavior and personnel management in the public sector.</p>

                <p>Outside of work, I like to read fiction and coach my son's baseball and basketball teams. I also like to watch NFL (Patriots) and college football, NBA (Celtics) and college basketball (American U), and my daughter's club soccer team (Arlington Soccer Association).</p>

                <p>Prior to working at American, I worked for ten years in the Schar School of Policy and Government at <a href="https://www.gmu.edu/">George Mason University</a>. During the 2017-2018 academic year, I was a Fellow at the <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov/">United States Office of Evaluation Sciences</a>, where I helped design experiments to evaluate federal policy and program effectiveness.</p>

                    <p class="pub-description">Pollard surveys the change in customs and orientations toward work that attended the rise of the factory mode of organization. Efficient factory production required a level of discipline and regularity that individuals were not used to. Factory employees had to be habituated to this new way of working, this new kind of employment.</p>
                <p class="paper-note">"The worker who left the background of his domestic workshop or peasant holding for the factory, entered a new culture as well as a new sense of direction. It was not only that `the new economic order needed...part-humans: soulless, depersonalised, disembodied, who could become members, or little wheels rather, of a complex mechanism'. It was also that men who were non-accumulative, non-acquisitive, accustomed to work for subsistence, not for maximization of income, had to be made obedient to the cash stimulus, and obedient in such a way as to react precisely to the stimuli provided."</p>
                <p class="pub-description">Students are suprised to learn that child labor was common, and that children began working at very young ages: </p>
                <p class="paper-note">"In the predominantly youthful population of the time, the proportion of young workers was high. In the Cumberland mines, for example, children started work at the ages of five to seven, and as late as 1842, 200-250 of the 1,300-1,400 workers in the Lonsdale mines were under eighteen. At Alloa collieries, 103 boys and girls of under seven were employed in 1780. In the light metal trades, the proportion was higher still. Josiah Wedgwood, in 1816, had 30 per cent of his employees under eighteen, 3.3 per cent under ten years of age. The greatest problems, however, were encountered in the textile mills."</p>

                    <p class="pub-description">Can a good argument change an individual’s mind? In two pre-registered experiments, we explore this question in the domain of public sector organizational performance. In each of these experiments, we observe human subjects as they engage in a conversation with a generative artificial intelligence (AI) programmed to persuade its interlocutors that United States federal agencies perform, on the whole, quite well. In a third pre-registered experiment, we explore the potential dark side of AI-based persuasion strategies by testing whether subjects find an AI that panders to their pre-existing beliefs about public sector performance more credible than an AI that challenges those beliefs. We develop a theory of effective argumentation to synthesize potential answers to an array of specific, practical questions of persuasion. To attempt to answer these questions, we program a large language model (LLM) to argue in one of seven distinct “styles,” including an aggressive style, a didactic style, and a sycophantic style. Our results suggest that these different argumentative styles vary in their effectiveness, and that there may be a dark side to LLM-based persuasion.</p>

                        <p class="figure-caption">Across three experiments, we put subjects in conversation with one of seven different LLM "styles," which we programmed to talk in different ways. In the third experiment, depicted above, we randomized subjects into one of four LLM styles: strong (shameless) sycophant, weak sycophant, strong challenger, and weak challenger. We observe what subjects say to the LLMs, as well as how long their conversations last.</p>

The figure shows subjects' ratings of four LLM styles: strong (shameless) sycophant, weak sycophant, strong challenger, and weak challenger. Subjects perceive the strongly sycophantic LLM to be more credible, more enjoyable, and less frustrating to talk to than the strong challenger LLM. Subjects also report being more likely to want to talk to the strongly sycophantic LLM again, and more likely to recommend the strongly sycophantic LLM to a friend.</p>

                    <p class="pub-venue"><em>American Review of Public Administration</em>, 2025</p>
                    <p class="pub-description">This study examines how meritocratic ideals can paradoxically reinforce inequality in federal agencies. Combining survey data from federal employees with administrative data on cash performance bonuses, I find that stronger belief in meritocracy is associated with greater acceptance of existing wage disparities, even when those disparities disadvantage one's own demographic group. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/02750740251340069">DOI</a></p>
