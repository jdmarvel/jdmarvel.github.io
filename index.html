                <p>I'm an Associate Professor of Public Administration at <a href="https://www.american.edu/">American University</a> in Washington, DC, where I teach courses on quantitative methods, organization theory, public management, and research design to MPA, MPP, and PhD students.</p>
                
                <p>My research examines how citizens form judgments about government performance, with a focus on experimental methods and statistical analysis. I'm particularly interested in the role of artificial intelligence in shaping democratic discourse and public opinion.</p>

                <p class="paper-note">"Child work immeasurably increased the complexities of the problem. It had, as such, been common enough before, but the earlier work pattern had been based on the direct control of children and youths, in small numbers, by their parents or guardians. The new mass employment removed the incentive of learning a craft, alienated the children by its monotony and did this just at the moment when it undermined the authority of the family, and of the father in particular. It thus had to rely often on the unhappy method of indirect employment by untrained people whose incentive for driving the children was their own piece-rate payment."</p>  
                             <p class="paper-note">"In the predominantly youthful population of the time, the proportion of young workers was high. In the Cumberland mines, for example, children started work at the ages of five to seven, and as late as 1842, 200-250 of the 1,300-1,400 workers in the Lonsdale mines were under eighteen. At Alloa collieries, 103 boys and girls of under seven were employed in 1780. In the light metal trades, the proportion was higher still. Josiah Wedgwood, in 1816, had 30 per cent of his employees under eighteen, 3.3 per cent under ten years of age. The greatest problems, however, were encountered in the textile mills."</p>

                    <p class="pub-description">Can a good argument change an individual’s mind? In two pre-registered experiments, we explore this question in the domain of public sector organizational performance. In each of these experiments, we observe human subjects as they engage in a conversation with a generative artificial intelligence (AI) programmed to persuade its interlocutors that United States federal agencies perform, on the whole, quite well. In a third pre-registered experiment, we explore the potential dark side of AI-based persuasion strategies by testing whether subjects find an AI that panders to their pre-existing beliefs about public sector performance more credible than an AI that challenges those beliefs. We develop a theory of effective argumentation to synthesize potential answers to an array of specific, practical questions of persuasion. To attempt to answer these questions, we program a large language model (LLM) to argue in one of seven distinct “styles,” including an aggressive style, a didactic style, and a sycophantic style. Our results suggest that these different argumentative styles vary in their effectiveness, and that there may be a dark side to LLM-based persuasion.</p>

                    <p class="pub-venue"><em>American Review of Public Administration</em>, 2025</p>
                    <p class="pub-description">This study examines how meritocratic ideals can paradoxically reinforce inequality in federal agencies. Combining survey data from federal employees with administrative data on cash performance bonuses, I find that stronger belief in meritocracy is associated with greater acceptance of existing wage disparities, even when those disparities disadvantage one's own demographic group.</p>
